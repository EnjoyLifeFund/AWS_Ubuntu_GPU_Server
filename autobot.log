==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall eigen@3.2`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/eigen@3.2/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/eigen@3.2/share/pkgconfig
