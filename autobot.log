==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall jpcsp`
==> Caveats
ISO/CSO images are to be placed in the following directory:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/jpcsp/Jpcsp.app/Contents/Resources/Java/umdimages

To avoid any incidental wipeout upon future updates, change it to
a safe location (under Options > Settings > General > UMD path folders).
