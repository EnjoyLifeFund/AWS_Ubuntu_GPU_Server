==> Caveats
Congratulations!  RepeatMasker is now ready to use.
The program is installed with a minimal repeat library
by default.  This library only contains simple, low-complexity,
and common artefact ( contaminate ) sequences.  These are
adequate for use with your own custom repeat library.  If you
plan to search using common species specific repeats you will
need to obtain the complete RepeatMasker repeat library from
GIRI ( www.girinst.org ) and install it:
  cd /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/repeatmasker/libexec
  tar zxvf repeatmaskerlibraries-20140131.tar.gz
  ./configure <config.txt

The default aligner is RMBlast. You may reconfigure RepeatMasker
by running
  cd /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/repeatmasker/libexec && ./configure
