==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this formula is mainly used internally by other formulae.
Users are advised to use `pip` to install sphinx-doc.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/sphinx-doc/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
