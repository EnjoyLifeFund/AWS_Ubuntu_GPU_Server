The formula built, but is not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
Could not symlink bin/fd
Target /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/fd
is a symlink belonging to fd. You can unlink it:
  brew unlink fd

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite fdclone

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run fdclone

Possible conflicting files are:
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/fd -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/fd/6.1.0/bin/fd
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/man/man1/fd.1 -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/fd/6.1.0/share/man/man1/fd.1
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall fdclone`
==> Caveats
To install the initial config file:
    install -c -m 0644 /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/fdclone/share/fd2rc.dist ~/.fd2rc
To set application messages to Japanese, edit your .fd2rc:
    MESSAGELANG="ja"
