==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall mitie`
==> Caveats
Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
