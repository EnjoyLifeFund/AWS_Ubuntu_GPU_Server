==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall dvm`
==> Caveats
dvm is a shell function, and must be sourced before it can be used.
Add the following command to your bash profile:
    [ -f /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/dvm/dvm.sh ] && . /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/dvm/dvm.sh
