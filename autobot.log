==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/portable/portable-readline`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because portable formulae are keg-only.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/portable-readline/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/portable-readline/include
