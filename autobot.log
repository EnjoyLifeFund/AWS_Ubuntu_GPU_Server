==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/neuron`
==> Caveats
NEURON recommends that you set an X11 option that raises the window
under the mouse cursor on mouseover. If you don't set this option,
NEURON's GUI will still work, but you will have to click in each window
before you can interact with the widgets in that window.

To raise the window on mouse hover, execute:
    defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_ffm -bool true
To revert this behavior, execute:
    defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_ffm -bool false

Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules
this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules,
please run:
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
