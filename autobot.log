==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gmp@4/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gmp@4/include
