==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/llvm@4/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/llvm@4/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/llvm@4/include


If you need Python to find bindings for this keg-only formula, run:
  echo /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/llvm@4/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/llvm@4.pth
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
