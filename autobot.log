==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall gnupg@1.4`
==> Caveats
This formula does not install either `gpg` or `gpgv` executables into
the PATH.

If you simply require `gpg` and `gpgv` executables without explicitly
needing GnuPG 1.x we recommend:
  brew install gnupg

If you really need to use these tools without the "1" suffix you can
add a "gpgbin" directory to your PATH from your ~/.bash_profile like:

    PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gnupg@1.4/libexec/gpgbin:$PATH"

Note that doing so may interfere with GPG-using formulae installed via
Homebrew.
