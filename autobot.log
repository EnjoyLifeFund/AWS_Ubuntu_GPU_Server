==> Downloading from https://codeload.github.com/junegunn/fzf/tar.gz/0.17.3
==> glide install
==> go build -o /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/fzf/0.17.3/bin/fzf -ldflags -X main.revision=brew
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall fzf`
==> Caveats
To install useful keybindings and fuzzy completion:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/fzf/install

To use fzf in Vim, add the following line to your .vimrc:
  set rtp+=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/fzf
