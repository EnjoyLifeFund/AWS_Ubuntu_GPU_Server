==> Installing gap from homebrew/science
==> Downloading https://www.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap48/tar.bz2/gap4r8p8_2017_08_20-15_12.tar.bz2
==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/gap/4.8.8/libexec --with-gmp=system --with-readline
==> make
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/gap`
==> Caveats
If the formula is installed without the `--with-packages' option,
some packages in:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gap/libexec/pkg
will need to be built manually with the following script:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gap/libexec/bin/BuildPackages.sh
See the Section 7 of /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gap/libexec/INSTALL for more info.
