==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall isl@0.11`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.11/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.11/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.11/lib/pkgconfig
