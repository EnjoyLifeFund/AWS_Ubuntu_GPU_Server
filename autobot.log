==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/libxml2@2.7/2.7.8 --without-python

==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall libxml2@2.7`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/libxml2@2.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/libxml2@2.7/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/libxml2@2.7/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/libxml2@2.7/lib/pkgconfig
