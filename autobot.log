==> Downloading https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-2.7.1.tar.gz
==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/bison@2.7/2.7.1_1
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall bison@2.7`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/bison@2.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/bison@2.7/lib
