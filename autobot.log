==> Installing glimmer3 from homebrew/science
==> Downloading https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/glimmer/glimmer302b.tar.gz
==> make
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/glimmer3`
==> Caveats
Glimmer3 is mostly used by calling the .csh scripts but if you need the
supporting binaries, they are in
    /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/glimmer3/libexec
