==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall glkterm`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because conflicts with other Glk libraries.

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/glkterm/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/glkterm/include
