Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not
in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules

please run:
  mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' >> /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/homebrew.pth
