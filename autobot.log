==> make
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall gdk-pixbuf`
==> Caveats
Programs that require this module need to set the environment variable
  export GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders"
If you need to manually update the query loader cache, set these variables then run
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gdk-pixbuf/bin/gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders --update-cache
