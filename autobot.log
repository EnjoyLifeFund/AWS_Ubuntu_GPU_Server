==> Installing hmmer2 from homebrew/science
==> Downloading http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/2.3.2/hmmer-2.3.2.tar.gz
==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/hmmer2/2.3.2 --mandir=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/hmmer2/2.3.2/share/man --enable-threads
==> make
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/hmmer2`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because hmmer2 conflicts with hmmer version 3.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/hmmer2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
