==> Installing littler from homebrew/science
==> Using Homebrew-provided fortran compiler.
This may be changed by setting the FC environment variable.
==> Downloading http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/littler/littler-0.2.3.tar.gz
==> ./configure --disable-silent-rules --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/littler/0.2.3_14
==> make littler.h
==> make
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/littler`
==> Caveats
This formula installs `r` as `littler` to avoid conflicting
with the Zsh builtin and case-insensitive filesystems.
