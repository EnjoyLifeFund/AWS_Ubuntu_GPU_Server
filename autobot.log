==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall juju@1.25`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/juju@1.25/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile


Bash completion has been installed to:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/bash_completion.d
