==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall isc-dhcp`
==> Caveats
This install of dhcpd expects config files to be in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc.
All state files (leases and pids) are stored in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/var/dhcpd.

Dhcpd needs to run as root since it listens on privileged ports.

There are two plists because a single dhcpd process may do either
DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 but not both. Use one or both as needed.

Note that you must create the appropriate config files before starting
the services or dhcpd will refuse to run.
  DHCPv4: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/dhcpd.conf
  DHCPv6: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/dhcpd6.conf

Sample config files may be found in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc.
