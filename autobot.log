==> Using a fortran compiler found at /usr/bin/gfortran.
This may be changed by setting the FC environment variable.
==> Downloading https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current18/src/hdf5-1.8.20.tar.bz2

==> ./configure --disable-silent-rules --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/hdf5@1.8/1.8.20 --with-szlib=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/szip --enable-build-mode=production --enable-fortran --enable-cxx
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall hdf5@1.8`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/hdf5@1.8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/hdf5@1.8/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/hdf5@1.8/include
