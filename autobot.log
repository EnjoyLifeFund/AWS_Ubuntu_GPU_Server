The formula built, but is not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
Could not symlink bin/count-kmers
Target /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/count-kmers
is a symlink belonging to quake. You can unlink it:
  brew unlink quake

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite amos

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run amos

Possible conflicting files are:
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/count-kmers -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/quake/0.3.5_2/bin/count-kmers
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/count-qmers -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/quake/0.3.5_2/bin/count-qmers
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/amos`
==> Caveats
The Perl modules have been installed in
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/amos/lib/AMOS
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/amos/lib/TIGR
