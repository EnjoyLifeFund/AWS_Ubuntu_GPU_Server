==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall ccache`
==> Caveats
To install symlinks for compilers that will automatically use
ccache, prepend this directory to your PATH:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/ccache/libexec

If this is an upgrade and you have previously added the symlinks to
your PATH, you may need to modify it to the path specified above so
it points to the current version.

NOTE: ccache can prevent some software from compiling.
ALSO NOTE: The brew command, by design, will never use ccache.
