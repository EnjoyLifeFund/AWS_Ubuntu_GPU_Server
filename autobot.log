==> Installing tisean from homebrew/science
==> Using Homebrew-provided fortran compiler.
This may be changed by setting the FC environment variable.
==> Downloading https://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/TISEAN_3.0.1.tar.gz
==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/tisean/3.0.1_4
==> make
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/tisean`
==> Caveats
By default, all TISEAN binaries are prefixed with `tisean-`.
For unprefixed binaries, use `--without-prefixed-binaries`.
