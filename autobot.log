==> Caveats
Before using Fail2Ban for the first time you should edit the jail
configuration and enable the jails that you want to use, for instance
ssh-ipfw. Also, make sure that they point to the correct configuration
path. I.e. on Mountain Lion the sshd logfile should point to
/var/log/system.log.

  * /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf

The Fail2Ban wiki has two pages with instructions for macOS Server that
describes how to set up the Jails for the standard macOS Server
services for the respective releases.

  10.5: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO_Mac_OS_X_Server_(10.5)

Please do not forget to update your configuration files.
They are in /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/fail2ban.
