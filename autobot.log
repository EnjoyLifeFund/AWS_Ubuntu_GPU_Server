==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/gpg-agent/2.0.30_3 --enable-agent-only --with-pinentry-pgm=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/pinentry/bin/pinentry --with-scdaemon-pgm=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gnupg@2.0/libexec/scdaemon
==> make install
==> Caveats
Remember to add "use-standard-socket" to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
file.

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because GPG 2.1.x ships an internal gpg-agent which it must use.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gpg-agent/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall gnupg@2.0`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gnupg@2.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
