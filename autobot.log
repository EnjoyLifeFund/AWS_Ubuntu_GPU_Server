==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/nfft`
==> Caveats
NFFT is built as serial (not multi-threaded) library by default
when being built with clang, as this compiler doesn't support
OpenMP.

A multi-threaded version of the NFFT library can be build with
Homebrew's GNU C compiler, using

  brew install nfft --with-openmp

which will create both serial and multi-threaded NFFT libraries.

Linking against the serial libraries:

   ... -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nfft/lib -lnfft -lfftw3 ...

Linking against the multi-threaded libraries (if built):

   ... -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nfft/lib -lnfft_threads -lfftw3_threads ...
