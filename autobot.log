You can run it manually using `brew postinstall dnscrypt-proxy`
==> Caveats
After starting dnscrypt-proxy, you will need to point your
local DNS server to 127.0.0.1. You can do this by going to
System Preferences > "Network" and clicking the "Advanced..."
button for your interface. You will see a "DNS" tab where you
can click "+" and enter 127.0.0.1 in the "DNS Servers" section.

By default, dnscrypt-proxy runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 53,
and under the "nobody" user using a random resolver. If you would like to
change these settings, you will have to edit the configuration file:
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.conf (e.g., ResolverName, etc.)

To check that dnscrypt-proxy is working correctly, open Terminal and enter the
following command. Replace en1 with whatever network interface you're using:

    sudo tcpdump -i en1 -vvv 'port 443'

You should see a line in the result that looks like this:

    resolver2.dnscrypt.eu.https
