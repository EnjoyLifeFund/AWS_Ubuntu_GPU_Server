The formula built, but is not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew
Could not symlink bin/populations
Target /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/populations
is a symlink belonging to populations. You can unlink it:
  brew unlink populations

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite stacks

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run stacks

Possible conflicting files are:
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/populations -> /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/populations/1.2.33-2_1/bin/populations
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/stacks`
