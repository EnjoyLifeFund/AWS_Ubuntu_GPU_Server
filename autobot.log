==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall homebrew/science/gaemr`
==> Caveats
After install GAEMR, you must do these 3 things:

1. Amend your UNIX PATH environmental variable to point to your
   installation of the GAEMR/bin directory:
   export PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gaemr/libexec/bin:$PATH
2. Amend your UNIX PYTHONPATH environmental variable to point to
   your installation of the GAEMR directory:
   export PYTHONPATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gaemr/libexec:$PYTHONPATH
3. Change the path variables in
   /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gaemr/libexec/gaemr/PlatformConstant.py
   to reflect your installation for the various bioinformatics tools.
