==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall cherokee`
==> Caveats
Cherokee is setup to run with your user permissions as part of the
www group on port 80. This can be changed in the cherokee-admin
but be aware the new user will need permissions to write to:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/var/cherokee
for logging and runtime files.

By default, documents will be served out of:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/cherokee/htdocs

And CGI scripts from:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/cherokee/cgi-bin

 If this is your first install, automatically load on startup with:
    sudo cp /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/cherokee/org.cherokee.webserver.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cherokee.webserver.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the plist loaded:
    sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cherokee.webserver.plist
    sudo cp /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/cherokee/org.cherokee.webserver.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cherokee.webserver.plist
