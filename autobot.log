==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall ctags`
==> Caveats
Under some circumstances, emacs and ctags can conflict. By default,
emacs provides an executable `ctags` that would conflict with the
executable of the same name that ctags provides. To prevent this,
Homebrew removes the emacs `ctags` and its manpage before linking.

However, if you install emacs with the `--keep-ctags` option, then
the `ctags` emacs provides will not be removed. In that case, you
won't be able to install ctags successfully. It will build but not
link.
